# Earthquake_Mapping
A simple project with JS Leaflet package to visualize Earthquake data with API

#### Purpose
I wanted to show the differences among the magnitudes of earthquakes world-wide for last week.

#### Tasks
I retrieved the earthquake data from USGS website in a GeoJSON format, which includes the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquake. Then I added the data into a map generated from MapBox API.

#### Approach
I used D3 library in JS to retrieve informations from the GeoJSON data. I plotted the base and overlay maps and added the interactivity for analyzing earthquake using the JS Leaflet library and Mapbox map.
